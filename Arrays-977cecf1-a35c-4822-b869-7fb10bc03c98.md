Arrays are *mutable* lists in JavaScript.

    let myArr = ["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"];

## Ways to access array items:

### Bracket Notation:

To access specific indexes within an array.

    myArr[2];

Would access the third item within `myArr`.

## Ways to add items to an array:

    myArr.push("item 4");

Would add *item 4* to the end of `myArr`. 

    myArr.unshift("item 0");

Would add *item 0* to the beginning of `myArr`. 

## Ways to remove items from an array:

    myArr.pop();

Would remove the last item from `myArr`.

    myArr.shift(); 

Would remove the first item from `myArr`.

    myArr.splice(indexStart, numberOfItems);

Would remove the item at the index given, followed by the amount of items given to it ***after*** that index.

   

## How to access the end of an array:

You can call `myArr.length` to get the full length of the array and then use bracket notation, or you could use:

    myArr[myArr.length - 1];
